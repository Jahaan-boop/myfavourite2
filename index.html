          Controller-based games can be great for your hands. In a study involving a group of surgeons, researchers found that those who played video games were faster at performing advanced procedures and made 37 percent fewer mistakes than those who didnâ€™t. Special video games have also been used as physical therapy to help stroke victims regain control of their hands and wrists.
